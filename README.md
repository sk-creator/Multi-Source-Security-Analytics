# Multi-Source-Security-Analytics
Hands-on SOC project simulating multi-source log ingestion, parsing, alerting, and correlation with ELK, Splunk, DAM logs, and API integration.


Project Overview

This project simulates a Level 2 SOC environment for learning and demonstrating real-world cybersecurity monitoring workflows.
It ingests and correlates logs from multiple sources authentication, firewall, network, and database activity monitoring (DAM) to detect suspicious activity, generate alerts, and simulate incident management.

The project includes hands on experience with:

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Filebeat)

Splunk Free / Trial

Python API scripts for threat enrichment

Log parsing (Grok in ELK, Rex in Splunk)

Dashboard creation and alert configuration

Tools & Technologies

ELK Stack → Log ingestion, parsing, dashboards

Splunk Free → Search, alerts, correlation

Python 3.x → API integration for threat intel and incident creation

Sample Logs → Auth, Firewall, Network, DAM

QNI Logic → Multi-log correlation for incident detection

Project Features

Multi-source log ingestion

Field extraction & parsing (ELK + Splunk)

Dashboard creation for failed logins, blocked IPs, and suspicious DB queries

Alert configuration for threshold and correlation scenarios

Simulated DAM activity monitoring and reporting

API integration for automated incident enrichment

Sample incident reports (Markdown/PDF)
